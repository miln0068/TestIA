## Welcome to the Prototype     

<!---I have created this site to test ideas about various aspects of information architecture including metadata, usability, and content strategy.      
My goal was to provide an environment to play with, design, test, and validate ideas as well to provide a more tangible context for less familiar concepts such as metadata and UX. 

## Overview  

Along the top of the page you will see six tabs labelled **News**, **Client Data**, **Documents**, **Applications**, **Financial**, and **Feedback**. This is where the test contents are going to be. Along the left side you will see a menu with (so far) three items: **Metadata**, **Usability**, and **Content Strategy**. This is where you will information about the site and information architecture.   

## First Steps  

Begin by exploring the menu on the left. In this menu you will find some first ideas about how content can be structured in a web-based information environment. This will include ideas about using metadata to facilitate navigation and searching. There are also sections with links to usability tests as well as the results. You can do these tests and then look at the results to see if they confirm your ideas.  

## Feedback  

My hope is that this site will provoke productive discussion about these ideas so please provide feedback. There are several ways to give feedback:   

- at the top of the page, there is a tab labelled **Feedback** that takes you to an email link  
- at the bottom of the page there is a space for comments  
- under the **Usability** tab in the menu on the left, there are sevral usability tests that have space for comments  

## Disclaimer  

Neither this site nor its contents are intended to be an authoritative statement on any of these topics, but rather a jumping off point for testing and refining ideas about information design.-->
