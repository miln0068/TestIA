If no positive match is made (since the individual is homeless, you will not be able to rely on matching address information) contact the applicant organization to attempt to obtain the SIN.
Since no specific residential address information will be available for the homeless individual, the applicant organization must confirm that the individual is living in Canada by providing the name of the community and province where the incapable individual resides.

Age can be verified using the standard process of comparing the information contained in the Social Insurance Registry (SIR) with that provided on the Certificate of Incapability.

Evaluating the Living Situation of a Homeless Individual
<Purpose>

<Background>
Prior to being appointed as a trustee to administer the CPP and OAS benefits of an incapable homeless, or at imminent risk of being homeless senior, the applicant organization must demonstrate that it has performed an evaluation of the individual’s living situation and determined that the individual is homeless or at imminent risk of being homeless. The factors to be considered are:
• Absence of a fixed home address
• A regular pattern of shelter usage
• Precarious/unsafe/inadequate housing arrangement
• Self-identification by the individual that they are homeless
<Agent Instructions>
The applicant organization will attest on the [LINK TO] ISP 3507 Agreement to Administer Benefits form that it has performed an evaluation of the incapable individual’s living situation and has determined that he or she is homeless or at imminent risk of being homeless and the factor(s) that the organization used to make that determination.
If the organization has not indicated which factor(s) were used to make the determination, it cannot be appointed to administer the benefits of the incapable individual. At least one factor must be indicated.
