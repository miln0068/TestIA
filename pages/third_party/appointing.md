This page provides processing tasks for administering a [LINK TO DEFINITION] power of attorney (POA) for Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS).    



## Identifying a Homeless Individual  

The following instructions detail the evidence that must be submitted by the organization applying to administer benefits on behalf of the individual.  

### Agent Instructions  

The name and Social Insurance Number (SIN) of the individual must be provided. If no SIN is provided, search the relevant system to attempt to positively identify the individual in question.
If no positive match is made (since the individual is homeless, you will not be able to rely on matching address information) contact the applicant organization to attempt to obtain the SIN.
Since no specific residential address information will be available for the homeless individual, the applicant organization must confirm that the individual is living in Canada by providing the name of the community and province where the incapable individual resides.   

## Confirming the Age of a Homeless Individual   

The following instructions detail the process for identifying the age of an incapable senior.     

The incapable senior must be 65 or within a year of reaching age 65. Applications received for incapable individuals can be accepted up to 11 months prior to the 65th birthday; however, payment of any benefits (those not already in pay) cannot begin until the month after the individual has reached the age of 65.    
### Agent Instructions    
Age can be verified using the standard process of comparing the information contained in the Social Insurance Registry (SIR) with that provided on the Certificate of Incapability.   

## Evaluating the Living Situation of a Homeless Individual   

Follow these procedures to evaluate the living situation of a homeless individual.     

Prior to being appointed as a trustee to administer the CPP and OAS benefits of an incapable homeless, or at imminent risk of being homeless senior, the applicant organization must demonstrate that it has performed an evaluation of the individual’s living situation and determined that the individual is homeless or at imminent risk of being homeless.   
The factors to be considered are:   
• Absence of a fixed home address  
• A regular pattern of shelter usage   
• Precarious/unsafe/inadequate housing arrangement   
• Self-identification by the individual that they are homeless  
### Agent Instructions    
The applicant organization will attest on the [LINK TO] ISP 3507 Agreement to Administer Benefits form that it has performed an evaluation of the incapable individual’s living situation and has determined that he or she is homeless or at imminent risk of being homeless and the factor(s) that the organization used to make that determination.   
If the organization has not indicated which factor(s) were used to make the determination, it cannot be appointed to administer the benefits of the incapable individual. At least one factor must be indicated.
