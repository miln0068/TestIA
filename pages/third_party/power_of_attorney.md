Powers of attorney usually cover two areas of decision-making: decisions about property (CPP & OAS benefits are considered property) and decisions about personal care.  

## General Provisions of a Power of Attorney  
[Third party](definitions.html) administration is legislated provincially and is unique to each province or territory. As such, all third party instruments must meet the legislated standards of the issuing province or territory to be considered valid. Refer to [EXTERNAL LINK TO LEGISLATION] for a list of provincial statutes and legislation.  
Authorizing instruments issued in one province are acceptable by another province, provided that the instrument meets the requirements of the latter.  
Valid proof of a POA contains each of the following elements (note that the content and format of a POA will vary depending on the province or territory):  
•	a title that describes the contents  
•	the title of the provincial/territorial act  
•	the name or names of individuals who have the power to act on behalf of the client  
•	a description of what the appointed third party (parties) may do on behalf of the client  
•	the duration of the appointment  
•	information about whether the power to act continues after the client becomes incapacitated  
•	the conditions under which the POA continues  
•	the name and signature of the client  
•	the name and signature of the person(s) named to act on behalf of the client  
•	the names and signatures of the witnesses  
•	the date the document was drafted
