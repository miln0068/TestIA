This page provides processing tasks for administering a [LINK TO DEFINITION] power of attorney (POA) for Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS).


## Determining the Validity of a Power of Attorney   

Follow these instructions to determine the validity of a power of attorney (POA).   

To determine the validity of a POA provided to Service Canada, the documents must meet the following requirements:
• meet the legal requirements under provincial law to be accepted
• be an officially executed document; written statements cannot be accepted as substitutes
• have no inconsistencies or contradictions that would make it invalid
• be an original or certified true copy
• be consistent with the client’s account information - contradictory statements raise doubt as to the documents validity. 

###Agent Instructions  

Here are some examples and strategies on how to deal with them:
Example: The department receives an application for OAS, along with a recently dated POA, and information exists that the client's affairs are being administered by the public trustee.   
Action: Contact the public trustee and ask them to apply for OAS. A public trustee is only responsible for a client who is not mentally able to care for his or her property. A public trustee takes precedence over a POA.  
Example: The department receives one or more documents naming separate individuals as attorney (and indicating different dates), and program records indicate no incapability.   
Action: Contact the client and ask if we may send the documents to him or her for verification or confirmation.  
Example: The department has appointed a person or agency as a trustee for one of our clients. However, we receive a POA naming an independent third party, dated earlier than the date of appointment.   
Action: Review the POA to ensure its validity. Advise the department-appointed trustee that the trusteeship is cancelled. Do not give appeal rights, as this appointment under our legislation is at the minister's discretion. Re-direct payment to the other party.   
Example: The department receives a POA for a mentally capable client. The POA comes into force in the event of any future incapability.    
Action: This POA is valid, but not yet in force. Benefits continue to be payable directly to the client, however, in the event that the client becomes incapable of managing their own affairs, the POA must submit a [LINK TO]Certificate of Incapability (ISP 3505) to begin exercising their authority with the Department.    

## Reviewing Power of Attorney Documents   

Follow these instructions to review power of attorney documents.  
### Agent Instructions     
1.	Review the terms on a POA to ensure that the third party has been appropriately empowered to represent the client. For example, a POA indicating "For Banking Purposes Only" is not sufficient for CPP or OAS purposes.   
2.	The authorizing instrument may have restrictions and/or limitations stated in the document. For instance, a POA may have a condition such as validating incapability before the POA is in force. In this case, verify the incapability before accepting the POA.    
3.	Screen POAs to verify that the person named on the POA is the same person who is acting on behalf of the individual.
