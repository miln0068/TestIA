Third Party Administration – Trusteeship <Scenario>
<Purpose>
Legislation permits the appointment of another person or agency, called a trustee, to legally act on behalf of a client. This trustee may apply for, receive, and administer benefits on behalf of a person who is incapable of managing their own financial affairs. The individual provinces and territories have jurisdiction in matters concerning the management of an individual's care, finances, and property. Refer to [EXTERNAL LINK TO LEGISLATION] for further information on these provincial statutes.
<Background>
When Does the Department Appoint a Trustee?
When there is no valid provincial or federal representative for an incapable client, the department may appoint a trustee. The appointment may be made only when it is concluded (on the basis of medical evidence) that the client is incapable of managing their own affairs due to infirmity, illness, insanity or other causes.
Two forms are used to establish an individual or organization as a trustee under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) programs: 
•	[LINK TO] ISP 3505 Certificate of Incapability 
•	[LINK TO] ISP 3506 Agreement to Administer Benefits Under the Old Age Security Act and/or the Canada Pension Plan by a Private Trustee
Ensure that any application or request from a department-appointed trustee for a change in payee for a benefit, a division of pension credits, or the sharing of a CPP retirement pension, is supported by both of these forms before appointing a trustee. When only one of these forms has been submitted, forward a copy of the missing form with an explanation that the department cannot appoint a trustee until it has been completed and returned. 
If the client receives both CPP and OAS benefits, one trustee should be appointed to administer both these benefits.
