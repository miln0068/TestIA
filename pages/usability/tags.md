## Introduction  
This page is about a form of metadata called tags. The purpose of tags is to provide an alternative form of navigation. Tags allow you to group pages through semantic connections rather than their location within a menu.  

## Using Tags as Navigation  
At the top of this page, you will see a tag called usability. That means this page has been tagged as having something to do with usability. If you click on the usability tag, you will go to a page that lists every page that is tagged with **usability** along with a brief summary. In practice that means that pages can be flexibly grouped according to their content.
