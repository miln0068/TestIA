## Introduction  
You have now moved from tags through links, a further method of navigating through the contents is through the search function.  
## Searching for Content Through Keywords  
Metadata tags grouped content semantically, links provided a direct navigation to other pages, links can provide another rich way to find content through keywords.  
The search will automatically look for words that are contained in the text. However, if we go a step further and provide metadata keywords, it can make the search function even more powerful.  
Let's try an example:  
You are searching this site for information on card sort testing, but you can't remember if it's a usability thing, a testing thing, or a UX thing. In fact, it's all of those. The first three terms are easy enough, they all appear within the text, so the search function will find them, but the last---UX---does not. UX is entirely defined as a metadata keyword.
