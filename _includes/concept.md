## Using Tags as NavigationÂ    
At the top of this page, you will see a tag called usability. That means this page has been tagged as having something to do with usability. If you click on the usability tag, you will go to a page that lists every page that is tagged with **usability** along with a brief summary. In practice that means that pages can be flexibly grouped according to their content.
